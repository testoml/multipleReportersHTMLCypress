# Reporter Cypress

## Introduction 
In automation, a reporter plays a crucial role in providing feedback and insights into the execution of test cases. Here are some key importance of reporters in automation:
*Visibility*: Reporters provide visibility into the test execution process by summarizing the results of the tests. This visibility helps in understanding which tests passed, failed, or encountered errors.
*Debugging*: When tests fail, reporters offer detailed information about the failures, including error messages, stack traces, and other diagnostic data. This aids in debugging and identifying the root cause of failures quickly.
*Traceability*: Reporters often include timestamps and other metadata, allowing for traceability of test results over time. This traceability is essential for tracking the progress of test suites across different builds or versions of the software.
*Customization*: Many reporting tools allow for customization of reports to suit specific requirements. This could include generating reports in different formats (HTML, XML, JSON, etc.), adding custom fields or annotations, or integrating with other tools in the development workflow.
*Historical Analysis*: Reporters typically store historical test results, enabling historical analysis and trend identification. Analyzing historical data can help in identifying patterns, detecting regressions, and making data-driven decisions to improve the quality of the software.
*Integration*: Reporters can integrate with other tools in the testing ecosystem, such as continuous integration (CI) servers, issue tracking systems, or test management platforms. Integration with these tools streamlines the testing process and facilitates collaboration among team members.
*Communication*: Test reports serve as a means of communication within the development team, providing stakeholders with insights into the quality of the software. Clear and concise reports help in communicating the status of the software and facilitating informed decision-making.


## Available reporter in cypress
As of the last update in January 2022, Cypress provides several built-in reporters and also supports third-party reporters. These reporters are used to format and display the results of your test runs. Here are the available reporters:
**Spec Reporter**:
This is the default reporter used by Cypress.
It prints test results to the terminal in a human-readable format.
It's suitable for small projects or for quick feedback during development.
**Mocha JSON Reporter**:
This reporter outputs test results in JSON format.
It's useful for integrating Cypress test results with other tools or systems.
**JUnit XML Reporter**:
This reporter generates XML files in JUnit format.
It's commonly used for integrating Cypress with continuous integration (CI) systems such as Jenkins or CircleCI.
**Mochawesome Reporter**:
This is a third-party reporter that generates HTML reports with rich formatting.
It provides detailed test results including test names, durations, commands, and screenshots.
It's popular for its visually appealing and informative reports.
Cypress Dashboard Service:
Cypress provides a cloud-based Dashboard Service that offers detailed test results, video recording, and parallelization capabilities.
It's a premium service offered by Cypress for teams and organizations.
**Third-party Reporters**:
Apart from the built-in reporters, Cypress also supports various third-party reporters.
These reporters are developed and maintained by the community and offer different features and formatting options.
Some examples include cypress-xunit, cypress-junit-reporter, cypress-slack-reporter, etc.

## Installation and  Configuration 
### Preconditions:
1. Set up a new project if you don't have one.  
Follow those steps if you are new [Cypress Installation](https://linktodocumentation)

### Steps:
We will install and configure our **HTML Report** with screenshots
1. Install Dependecies
- Install Mocha
- Install cypress-multi-reporters
- Install mochawesome
- Install mochawesome-merge

One command to install all
```sh
npm install mocha cypress-multi-reporters mochawesome mochawesome-merge mochawesome-report-generator
```
2. Set configurations in the cypress.json file:
```sh
const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  reporter: "cypress-multi-reporters",
  reporterOptions: {
    reporterEnabled: "mochawesome",
    mochawesomeReporterOptions: {
      reportDir: "cypress/reports/mocha",
      quiet: true,
      overwrite: false,
      html: false,
      json: true
    }
  },
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      // implement node event listeners here
    },
  },
});

```
